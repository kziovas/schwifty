Changelog
=========

Versions follow `CalVer <http://www.calver.org/>`_ with the scheme ``YY.0M.Micro``.

`2022.09.0`_ - 2022/16/09
-------------------------
Added
~~~~~
* IBAN validation for Senegal `mkopec87 <https://github.com/mkopec87>`_

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Refactored most of the scripts to generate the bank registry to use Pandas `@pebosi <https://github.com/pebosi>`_

`2022.07.1`_ - 2022/28/07
-------------------------
Fixed
~~~~~
* In some countries the BBAN does not include a bank code, but only a branch code (e.g. Poland). In
  those cases the branch code should be used to lookup the bank associated to an IBAN instead of the
  obviously empty bank code.

`2022.07.0`_ - 2022/07/07
-------------------------
Fixed
~~~~~
* Hungarian bank registry generator script was fixed by `@Krystofee <https://github.com/Krystofee>`_

`2022.06.3`_ - 2022/06/29
-------------------------
Added
~~~~~
* Generated list of Lithuanian BICs `@Draugelis <https://github.com/Draugelis>`_
* Removed manually curated list of Lithuanian banks.

`2022.04.2`_ - 2022/04/29
-------------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Allow getting bank names from IBAN. Previously, you could do ``iban.bic.bank_names[0]``, but since
  a BIC can be associated to multiple bank codes the context of the specific bank is lost and you
  could end up with the wrong bank name. `@jose-reveni <https://github.com/jose-reveni>`_


`2022.04.1`_ - 2022/04/29
-------------------------

Changed

`2022.03.0`_ - 2022/03/04

~~~~~
* The :class:`.IBAN` and :class:`.BIC` classes now support the ``__len__`` method to allow a more

-------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* Added 440 additional bank records for Spain.

`2021.10.1`_ - 2021/10/11
-------------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

  Thank you `@a-recknagel <https://github.com/a-recknagel>`_ for the idea!

Fixed
~~~~~
* Ensure that Belgian BBAN checksums are always 2 digits long.

`2021.10.0`_ - 2021/10/01
-------------------------

Added
~~~~~

Changed
~~~~~~~
* Updated bank registry for Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Netherlands, Poland,
  Slovenia and Slovakia.

Fixed
~~~~~
* Disallow ``schwifty`` to be installed for Python versions older than 3.7. It was unsupported
  before but is now rejected upon installation with an appropriate error message.
* Austrian bank codes are now consistently left padded with zeros. This fixes the mapping from
  IBAN to BIC for the Austrian federal bank institutes.

`2021.06.1`_ - 2021/06/24

  checksum when using the :meth:`.IBAN.generate`-method. `@mhemeryck <https://github.com/mhemeryck>`_

`2021.05.1`_ - 2021/05/20
-------------------------

Added
~~~~~
* The IBAN validation now optionally includes the verification of the country specific checksum
  within the BBAN. This currently works for German and Italian banks. For German banks the checksum
  algorithm for the account code is chosen by the bank code. Since there are over 150 bank specific
  algorithms in Germany not all of them are implemented at the moment, but the majority of banks
  should be covered.
